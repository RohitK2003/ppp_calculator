# Know Your Required Salary

## Description
"Know Your Required Salary" is a PPP (Purchase Power Parity) Calculator designed to provide an innovative approach to estimating the equivalent salary in various countries based on the user's expectations in INR (Indian Rupees). Unlike traditional currency converters that rely on direct exchange rates, this project leverages the concept of purchase power parity to offer a more nuanced and realistic estimation of the required salary in the target country.

## Features
<uL> <li>Multi-Currency Support : Estimate the required salary in countries such as America, Singapore, China, U.K., Australia, and U.A.E. based on the user's expectations in INR.</li>
<li>Windows System Compatibility: Built using Visual Studio, Windows Forms, and C++, ensuring seamless integration and ease of use on Windows systems.</li></uL>

## How it works
This project utilizes purchase power parity, a theory that considers the relative value of currencies based on their purchasing power for a standard basket of goods. The result is a more accurate reflection of the required salary in different countries, taking into account the cost of living.
